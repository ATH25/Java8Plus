 * ----------------------
 * Demonstrates how Java 8 Lambda expressions simplify the creation
 * of functional interface implementations.
 *
 * Instead of using an anonymous inner class, we directly assign
 * a lambda expression to the interface.
 *
 * NOTE:
 * This works because Greeting2 is a Functional Interface â€” it has exactly one abstract method.
 * The compiler can safely map the lambda expression to that method.
 * If there were multiple abstract methods, this would not be allowed.
